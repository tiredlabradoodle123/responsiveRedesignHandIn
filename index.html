        <h1>The Nami Sushi Restaurant Providence:</h1>
        <p>This website explains my project on Responsive Redesign. I chose to redesign the website of the Providence
          sushi restaurant, Nami.
          I observed several key issues with the website in its current state and developed low-fi and high-fi
          prototypes to redevelop this website.
          I then created a new website reflecting how improvements could be made. Enjoy!</p>

        <h1>Why Did I choose this Website?</h1>
        <p>I chose this website as there are many flaws in its construction that prevent it from being as efficient and
          streamlined as it could be. The most significant flaw in the website is that it is incredibly hard to read,
          also there is repetition of information,
          inclusion of extraneous details and an unproductive arrangement of information. </p>

        <h1>Finding Problems:</h1>
        <h2>Usability:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Due to the layout of the website and the incredibly poor color scheme, the Nami home page is not very user
            friendly. It is very inefficient as it does not reflect the priorities of the user.</li>
          <li>There is a tag linking to their instagram page but it does not work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Learnability:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It is hard for the user to learn how the website works as it is so hard to read. Once you eventually come
            to grips with whether everything is, it is simple enough, but this could be designer much better. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Memorability:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The syntax used is recognisable and easy to remember. Information about the restaurant itself is harder
            for the user to retain because of poor visuals. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conceptual model:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Conceptually, the purpose of this website is clear, one should be able to learn about what food the
            restaurant offers, its hours of operation, its location and images and reviews can also be included. The
            current website doesn’t demonstrate the information in this order, the way a user would want to navigate the
            restaurant.
            The website does include all of these components, but it does so in a visually ineffective way. </li>

            <td>
              <li>There is a disconnect between the system and the real world in that the website is much harder to
                navigate than necessary, potentially leading to lost customer interest. </li>
              <li>There is no sense of reality to the customer views, ie no review platform linked, just a quote and a
                name. </li>

                scheme do not match and make the website jarring to use. The text spacing is also inconsistent.</li>

                hard to tell what food is even being offered as the description is so dark. </li>

              <li>Incredibly inefficient to use, the information is not organized effectively. Reservations, location,
                times and menu should come first, not a long description, wordy of the restaurant and staff. </li>

                atrocious. </li>
              <li>The video included is unnecessary and actual useful information such as location and hours is hidden

        <p>WebAIM WAVE detected 36 contrast errors, something that I clearly identified as an issue in my analysis. They
          also noted the skipped heading level, alternative text, unordered list etc - essentially identifying the
          issues in format of font, scale and text distribution that I had mentioned. The errors found were less
          structural and more visual, which is what I had also perceived. </p>
